Problem: Collecting water consumption data across societies in Pune.

Solution: At the society level gather readings and store on the Gateway (Linux Box). Periodically update the master DB with this aggregate data over the period.

1. Gathering reading and aggregating them 
2. Storing data in Local DB on gateway    
3. Sync data to a Cloud service for fancy displaying :P or applying rules over it.
4. Sending commands back to gateway for control based on the rules.

Done!!!
